        <p> Grace Tame (born 1994) is a Tasmanian Australian woman, who gained national respect by standing up to the
            media and advocating for herself and other survivors of sexual assault.
            Grace was a student at St Michael's Collegiate school - holding dual scholarships to attend the prestigious
            school. Throughout her schooling, Grace struggled with her mental health and was battling Anorexia Nervosa
            when she was first targeted by her High School Mathematics teacher.

            Below is a timeline of the events leading up to Grace's Australian of the Year Nomination, and win. </p>

        <ul id="timeline">
            <li><strong> April 2010</strong> The maths teacher, who will remain un-named in this page, starts to show
                interest in Grace. He allows her to confide in him, and gives her a key to his office.</li>
            <li><strong>April - June 2010</strong> The pair have regular meetings, with other teachers enabling the
                contact between the two, by taking Grace to him when she felt overwhelmed at school.</li>
            <li><strong>June 2010</strong> The teacher locks Grace in a cupboard, reinacting previous trauma, and
                sexually assaulting her.</li>
            <li><strong>April 2011</strong> After approximately 30 instances of physical and sexual assault, Grace finds
                the courage to report her abuser.</li>
            <li><strong>August 2011</strong> The teacher is found guilty of "Maintaining a sexual relationship with a
                minor" and "Posession of child pornography" and sentenced to 2 years, 10 months in prison.</li>
            <li><strong>March 2013</strong> The perpetrator is released from prison, after serving 18 months of his 34
                month sentence.</li>
            <li><strong>Late 2015 - Early 2016</strong> The perpetrator brags on the internet about the assault being
                "awesome", and formally reoffends when he is found with more child pornography.</li>
            <li><strong> June 2016</strong> The perpetrator is released after serving a further four months.</li>
            <li><strong>May 2017</strong> The perpetrator is currently a student at the University of Tasmania - and
                other students file a formal petition to have him removed from campus for their safety. The perpetrator
                threatens to file a lawsuit in response. This is particularly hurtful because the University of Tasmania
                is the only university in the state - forcing Grace to choose between being at the Uni with her
                assaulter, or leave home to study alone. Grace chose to leave Australia.</li>
            <li><strong>December 2017</strong> Media Commentator Bettina Arndt interviews the perpetrator (the video of
                which has now been removed from the internet), making the perpetrator out to be a matyr who has been
                falsely accused and laying blame at Grace's feet.</li>
            <li><strong>September 2018</strong> The "End Rape on Campus" campaign formally goes to TESQA - the
                university regulatory body. It is ruled in favour of the complainants - and the perpetrator is removed.</li>
            <li><strong>November 2018</strong> Grace starts the #Letherspeak campaign - advocating for the amendment to
                the laws in Tasmania that prevent victims of sexual violence from speaking out. This is likely directly
                in response to her perpetrator being able to talk negatively about her.</li>
            <li><strong>April 2020</strong> The Law that forced Survivors to be silent was overturned, allowing Grace to
                speak about her struggles.</li>
            <li><strong>April - October 2020</strong> Grace becomes an advocate, speaking out about sexual assault and the struggles that face survivors.</li>
            <li><strong>October 2020</strong> Nominated and won, Tasmanian of the Year.</li>
            <li> <srong>January 2021</strong> Nominated and won, Australian of the Year.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Grace's speech at the Australian of the Year awards described as "inspiring". A highlight of her speech:
    <blockquote>All survivors of child sexual abuse, this is for us ... When we share, we heal. Together we can end
        child sexual abuse. I remember him saying, 'Don't make a sound.' Well, hear me now, using my voice amongst a
        chorus of voices that will not be silenced."</blockquote>
